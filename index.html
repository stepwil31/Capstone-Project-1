            A versatile, analytical and hard-working full stack developer from a analytical DevOps and Oracle Systems Engineer background.
            I enjoy having a very hands on solution based approach and thrive on the setup of new infrastructure and the recovery of crashed systems.
            My career and evolved into Development which really feeds into my creative side and satisfies my need to create something new and unique. 
            I look forward to assisting you with the Project you need to deliver. I have full security clearance sponsored by the Bank of England until June 2027.
